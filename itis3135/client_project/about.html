                <p>Aurelia (Lia) Medina is a student at UNCC with plans to study astrology. They love playing minecraft along with other games like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing. When asked "why do you like building in Minecraft" the reasons are passion-filled. They love the noises of the blocks and the hard work it takes to gather and build beautiful constructions. Not only that but its nice to admire your own work after putting in countless hours. Among their many love languages, gift giving is one of them and they enjoy doing things that make others happy.</p>
