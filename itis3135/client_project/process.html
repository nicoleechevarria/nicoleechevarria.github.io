					<h3>Getting Inspired</h3>
					<div>
						<p>Spending hours on Pintrest, Instagram, and TikTok to gain some inspiration 
                            on what type of wood would look best and which cut of stone is most convinient.</p>
						<p>It's not easy coming up with ideas, if you were to work with Lia for a build in your
                            world, they would listen to what you want it to look like and bring you ideas to ensure 
                            your complete satisfaction. Think of Lia as a magical realtor.
