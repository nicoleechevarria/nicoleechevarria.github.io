            <p>
                Duolingo is a personalized language learning service geared toward giving consumers small, managable assignments so that they can learn a completely different langauge.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Duolingo has a beautiful theme where blue backgrounds have white text and white backgrounds have black text.</li>
                <li>Repitition: Everything from the font to the graphics of their mascot, Duo, are consistent throughout the whole website.</li>
                <li>Allignment: Every section is centered and all the text align to the left</li>
                <li>Proximity: From the text boxes to the sections themselves, either the background changes color or there is a divider.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="exmouthView">
            <h3><a href="http://www.exmouth-view.co.uk/" target="_blank">Exmouth View Website</a></h3>
            <p>
                This website is a means of getting anyone viewing it to learn some of the history of the Exmouth View Hotel. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: There is clear contrast between the header, footer and body and even the side panel.</li>
                <li>Repitition: The only source of repetition is the text which is all in a uniform font.</li>
                <li>Allignment: Every section has the same margin and padding except for the footer. Thats the only reason it seems unaligned at the bottom.</li>
                <li>Proximity: The header could be thinner so that it does not seem like the only thing on the page when its first open. Other than that there is even spacing and such.</li>
