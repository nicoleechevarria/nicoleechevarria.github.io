                <p>My sister is 17 years older than me, so when she would bake cookies on a casual Saturday, I was baking right alongside her. I picked up a whisk at 7 and never stopped after.</p>

                <h3>My Materials</h3>
                <p>Over the years I've gotten so many trinkets and decorating tools that I have bits of my baking stuff everywhere. It got to the point where I needed my own shelf in the pantry. My brother got me a stand mixer in 2018 but before that I used a hand mixer (builds the muscle).</p>

                <h3>Regular Card Games</h3>
                <p>Well here is the beauty of card games...THERE IS NO RIGHT TIME! Card games can be played anytime of the year except for the obvious snowy day outside. But in theory it is still entierly possible to do this. I would just recommend doing it in a warmer dry environment then on a snowy or rainy day outside.</p>

                <p>Just like with regular card games you can play this whenever! The only limitation is charge of your device and your willingness to lose hours of time inside these games.</p>

                    <p>Cards quite honestly can be played anywhere! That is one of the amazing aspects about it. When it really comes down to it, the only limitation to the excitement card games offer is one's willingness to play card games. You can do this in your living room with the TV on, in the kitchen while you are cooking, or even in the walmart on one of their tables!</p>

                    <h3>Why Card Games?</h3>
                    <p>Card Games were always, as weird as it sounds, an escape from reality for myself. I could use this as a way to just take a break and do something with my grandpa that was fun. It was something that I looked forward to after getting back from class. This only became more important when I found groups of friends that loved card games too and we would hold these "tournaments" where we would compete with each other. In short it holds a lot of sentimental value becuase of all the tough times it has gotten me through.</p>
