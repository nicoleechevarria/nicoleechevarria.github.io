        Project overview: 
        Describe your application and its purpose.
            The application will be used to  
        Intended users of the website. 
        Overview of the content of the website

        Client Information: 
        Name of the client
        Organization/Institute/Business the client/s are associated with
        Client’s valid email address : aurnaymed134340@gmail.com
        Client’s phone number (if they are willing to share) : [private]
        Wireframe: 
        Site Map: Before you start coding, you need to understand what pages you will need to create  and how you will navigate between them. Below is an example of a site map. Use Draw.io to create the sitemap. Share the image and link to it from within your design doc page, and then embed it nicely with figure and figcaption. 
        Your website must have 5 or more pages, including
        A home page (index.html) 
        Navigation Bar that enables single-clicks to each of the five pages (if you have more, submenus are OK, as appropriate)
        Component header and footers that are consistent across the web application (footers  should include HTML and CSS validation links)
        Interactivity using JavaScript/jQuery 
        jQuery-UI widget and other plugins 
        AJAX functionality
        Page Design: For each page listed in your site map, provide at least the following information:
        The name of the page
        Purpose of the page
        Audience/Users of page (customer, admin, etc.)
        What will be content of the page? 
        Is this a page where you are asking users to enter data on the page?
        Will those data fields need any validations (if any)? 
        Will the page contain buttons or hyperlinks or drop downs?
        What actions will happen in the page? (such as, when user clicks on a button - data processed, navigate to other page, search based on value, etc.?)
        Any special notes regarding the page (if any)?
